# AI Agents: Session Zero - Study Group

## Objective
Understand the basics of AI agents.

### **What is an AI Agent?**
An AI agent is an **autonomous system** designed to interact with its environment and achieve specific goals independently. It operates by perceiving its surroundings, making decisions, and taking actions to optimize its objectives.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Autonomous**: Operates without human intervention.
- **Interactive**: Engages with the environment to gather information and influence outcomes.

### **Core Concepts**
To fully grasp the functioning of AI agents, it is important to understand the following terms:

#### 1. **Agent**
The **agent** is the decision-making entity. It:
- Takes actions in the environment.
- Learns from interactions to achieve a specific goal.
- In reinforcement learning, it seeks to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

#### 2. **Environment**
The **environment** is everything the agent interacts with. It:
- Defines the context in which the agent operates.
- Provides feedback based on the agent’s actions.

#### 3. **State**
The **state** is the configuration or condition of the environment at any given time. It:
- Provides the agent with necessary information for decision-making.
- Can include both observable variables and hidden factors, depending on the problem.

#### 4. **Action**
An **action** is any move or decision the agent can take in response to the current state. It:
- Comes from a set called the **action space**.
- Is chosen based on the agent’s **policy**, a strategy for decision-making.

#### 5. **Reward**
The **reward** is a numerical value provided to the agent after it performs an action in a given state. It:
- Indicates the quality of the agent’s action in achieving its goal.
- Guides the agent to optimize future decisions by maximizing cumulative rewards (or "return").
