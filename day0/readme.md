# AI Agents: Session Zero - Study Group

## Objective
Understand the basics of AI agents and explore the concept of agentic AI.

### **What is an AI Agent?**
An AI agent is an **autonomous system** designed to interact with its environment and achieve specific goals independently. It operates by perceiving its surroundings, making decisions, and taking actions to optimize its objectives.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Autonomous**: Operates without human intervention.
- **Interactive**: Engages with the environment to gather information and influence outcomes.

### **Core Concepts**
To fully grasp the functioning of AI agents, it is important to understand the following terms:

#### 1. **Agent**
The **agent** is the decision-making entity. It:
- Takes actions in the environment.
- Learns from interactions to achieve a specific goal.
- In reinforcement learning, it seeks to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

#### 2. **Environment**
The **environment** is everything the agent interacts with. It:
- Defines the context in which the agent operates.
- Provides feedback based on the agent’s actions.

#### 3. **State**
The **state** is the configuration or condition of the environment at any given time. It:
- Provides the agent with necessary information for decision-making.
- Can include both observable variables and hidden factors, depending on the problem.

#### 4. **Action**
An **action** is any move or decision the agent can take in response to the current state. It:
- Comes from a set called the **action space**.
- Is chosen based on the agent’s **policy**, a strategy for decision-making.

#### 5. **Reward**
The **reward** is a numerical value provided to the agent after it performs an action in a given state. It:
- Indicates the quality of the agent’s action in achieving its goal.
- Guides the agent to optimize future decisions by maximizing cumulative rewards (or "return").

### **Agentic AI: Extending the Concept of AI Agents**

**Agentic AI** refers to advanced AI systems that demonstrate a higher degree of independence, initiative, and adaptability. While traditional AI agents operate within predefined frameworks, agentic AI pushes the boundaries by showcasing characteristics that make them appear more "agent-like," often capable of pursuing open-ended goals.

#### Key Attributes of Agentic AI

1. **Proactivity**:
   - Unlike basic AI agents that react to their environment, agentic AI systems can proactively take the initiative to explore, plan, and act toward achieving overarching goals.

2. **Goal Orientation**:
   - They operate not just on immediate rewards but also focus on achieving long-term, multi-step objectives.

3. **Generalization**:
   - These systems can adapt to new environments or tasks they have not been explicitly trained on, demonstrating versatility in decision-making.

4. **Self-improvement**:
   - Agentic AI can learn from past actions, adjust strategies, and refine its capabilities without direct human intervention.

5. **Multi-agent Collaboration**:
   - Agentic AI systems often interact and collaborate with other agents (human or AI), solving complex problems through cooperative strategies.

#### Applications of Agentic AI

1. **Autonomous Vehicles**:
   - Navigating complex environments, making real-time decisions, and learning from traffic patterns.

2. **AI-powered Assistants**:
   - Systems like virtual personal assistants that can schedule tasks, handle emails, and proactively offer solutions to unstructured problems.

3. **AI in Research**:
   - Conducting experiments, hypothesizing, and iterating scientific research with minimal supervision.

4. **Game AI**:
   - AI systems that not only adapt to player strategies but can also propose new challenges or narratives.

#### Challenges and Considerations

- **Ethical Concerns**: Agentic AI systems making autonomous decisions raise questions about accountability and ethical constraints.
- **Complexity Management**: Designing and maintaining such systems requires robust frameworks to prevent unintended behaviors.
- **Safety**: Ensuring agentic AI aligns with human values and does not cause harm is a critical challenge.
