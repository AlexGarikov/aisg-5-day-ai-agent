# Session 2: Introduction to Learning Agents

## Objective

Understand the different types of agents.


### Hands-On Exercise

Build a learning agent that collects rewards if the agent moves in the right direction.

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning technique where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjusting its behavior to maximize the cumulative reward.

### Study the basics of Reinforcement Learning (RL):

- States
- Actions
- Rewards
