# Session 3: Multi-Agent Systems with LLMs


## Objective:
Explore collaborative and competitive agent systems.

## Core Concepts:

### 1. **Agent Collaboration**
   - How multiple LLM agents can work together.

### 2. **Task Delegation**
   - Using specialized agents for specific tasks.

### 3. **Challenges**
   - Managing communication and context sharing.

## Hands-On Exercise:
Implement a multi-agent system where one agent generates text, and another critiques or improves it.

### Example:
Write an agent that drafts a cover letter and another that edits it for grammar and style.
